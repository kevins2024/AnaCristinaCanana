# Portfolio for Ana Cristina Canana

## An Internet Presence for a UX Designer

Ana Cristina is a designer and designed this site. Imagine being a designer but not a developer; you would be tied to whatever templates you could find on WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get) editors online. This is not a suitable way to showcase your design ability to the world. So, this site aims to turn one of her designs into a viewable page while trying to adhere to the design as closely as possible.

## Developer todos

- [ ] CSS variables
- [ ] Change layout to be responsive
- [ ] Many todos scattered around the code in in comments
- [ ] Make a click-to-enlarge image feature
- [ ] Move images someplace faster than github
- [x] CSS change pointer on hover over clickable images (link, enlarge)
- [ ] The deploy script works, but adding `--cname <CNAME>` is likely a better way to go than the file copy currently in use
- [ ] MyOrb project preview image is not centered within the image itself
