# Portfolio for Ana Cristina Canana

## An Internet Presence for a UX Designer

Ana Cristina is a designer and designed this site. Imagine being a designer but not a developer; you would be tied to whatever templates you could find on WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get) editors online. This is not a suitable way to showcase your design ability to the world. So, this site aims to turn one of her designs into a viewable page while trying to adhere to the design as closely as possible.
