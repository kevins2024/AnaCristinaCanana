/*
I generally don't like to use the same names for things to avoid confusion.
For example, import a from "a"; let a = a;  It works, it might never cause 
an issue, but in general I try to avoid it. Here, though, with a large list
of items and needing to have multiple names for each (potentially) I've 
decided to just take the quickest/simplest route with naming and circle back
later to see if there are any issues created.
